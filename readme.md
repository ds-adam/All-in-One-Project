# ALL IN ONE PLACE PROJECT
In this project, I will try to create a website that will contain all essential information about certain number of US-based public companies. The fist part consists of getting historical stock price and show it as a graph using TD Ameritrade API and matplotlib. The next part is to scrape fundamental info from websites such as finviz or use an appropriate TD Ameritrade API.
