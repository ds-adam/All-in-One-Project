# ALL IN ONE PLACE PROJECT
In this project, I am trying to create a GUI application that one can use to access all essential corporate information about a given US-based public company by just inputting several parameters. On a high level, the program looks like this: 


 all tickers of all US-based public companies by scraping finviz.com's main page;  and show it as a graph using TD Ameritrade API and matplotlib. The next part is to scrape fundamental info from websites such as finviz or use an appropriate TD Ameritrade API. 

### Part One 
The part one of the project is nearly completed. In it, with two inputs, a stock ticker and a period number (years), one will be able to see a roughly formatted graph of historical price.
